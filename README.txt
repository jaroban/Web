This is a web application that we used for a christian youth conference and camp in Slovakia. 

The conference was a bit more complicated as it had church info, t-shirt selection and badges.

The camp was very simple - just signing up.

The mailer sends emails to people who signed up.

The variable symbol thing creates unique IDs that people have to include in their bank transfer so we can identify who the payment came from.
